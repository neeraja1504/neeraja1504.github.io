Iâ€™m **Neeraja Kirtane**, a recent **MSCS graduate** from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I was advised by [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/) and [Prof. Dilek Hakkani-TÃ¼r](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/dilek).

My research focuses on building **trustworthy and interpretable NLP systems**. At UIUC, I worked on:

- **[FactCheckmate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02899)**: Preemptively detecting and mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their hidden states.
- **[Jailbreaking LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14073)**: Designing scientific-sounding prompts that elicit biased or toxic responses from LLMs, revealing vulnerabilities in instruction following.

Currently, I am:
- Collaborating with **[Prof. Kuan-Hao Huang](https://khhuang.me/)** (Texas A&M University) on probing reasoning in **multilingual LLMs** using interpretability tools.
- Interning at **[MathGPT.ai](https://mathgpt.ai)**, where Iâ€™m developing a **benchmark** to evaluate the reasoning robustness of SOTA models and fine-tuning **small language models (SLMs)** for AI tutoring needs and applications.

Previously, I was a **Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow** at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI (RBCDSAI)](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/) at **IIT Madras**, advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/), where I built intelligent tools to generate Wikipedia biographies for women in STEM.

Iâ€™m currently seeking **PhD opportunities** or **full-time research roles** in _AI safety, robustness, and interpretability_.

<!-- Iâ€™m Neeraja Kirtane, a second-year Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/) and [Prof. Dilek Hakkani-TÃ¼r](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/dilek).

My research focuses on making natural language processing (NLP) models more trustworthy and interpretable. Recently, I worked on preemptively detecting and mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their hidden states [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02899). I am also exploring methods for jailbreaking LLMs to generate harmful content and developing strategies to counteract such vulnerabilities [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14073).

Prior to UIUC, I was a Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI [(RBCDSAI)](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/) at IIT Madras, where I was advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) There, I developed automated machine learning tools to generate Wikipedia biographies for notable women in STEM.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in the areas of AI safety, robustness, and trustworthy machine learning.

Previously, I was a Post Baccalaureate fellow at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI [RBCDSAI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/), IITM Chennai. I was advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and worked on building automated ML tools to generate wikipedia biographies for notable women in STEM. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology in Manipal, Karnataka, India.
<br>

<!-- I worked with Prof. Balaraman Ravindran and Dr Rajashree Baskaran on the project [Hidden Voices](https://hidden-voices.github.io/). This is an open-source project with the initial goal of building intelligent tools to aid in adding 10,000 women's biography drafts to Wikipedia. It aims to make a positive impact on gender representation among digital sources and to reduce the gender data gap. Previously in my undergraduate studies, I have worked on finding out occupational stereotypes and mitigating the gender bias in Hindi and Marathi language models. -->

<!-- I am Neeraja Kirtane, a final year undergrad student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. Currently I am interning at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artifical Intelligence(RBCDSAI) at IIT Chennai, where I am working on graph DL. I am very passionate about Technology and Maths and love to learn new things. Previously I have worked on finding and mitigating gender bias from text data. I have specifically worked in Hindi and Marathi languages to address this gender bias issue. I strongly believe that technology should not be just restricted to English speakers and should be available to all. Also, these systems should be free from bias of all forms. My research interests lie in NLP and Graph Deep Learning. I am specifically interested in Fairness in NLP as well working on low resource and gendered languages in NLP. I believe in socially aware and ethically responsible AI systems. \

<!-- Hello, I'm am currently a student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) pursuing my [MS in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science). I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer and Communication Engineering at [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://manipal.edu/mit.html) in Manipal, Karnataka, India. 
<br>

My research interests are in the field of Computer Vision, Continual Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Semi/Self-supervised Learning and NLP. Solving deep learning problems using a limited (ideally zero) amount of data is what piques my interest. 
<br>

Prior to this I have worked as a research assistant at the Aritificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India in the field of Continual Zero-Shot Learning. I have also worked as a AI Developer at Project MANAS working on their self-driving car and later as a AI Researcher at Research Society Manipal where I primarily worked in developing AI solutions in low resource scenarios. 
<br>

During my free time I try to stream research paper explanations on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/SahilKhose). 
The [Talks section](https://sahilkhose.github.io/talks/) include the explanations presented by me.
The [Feed section](https://sahilkhose.github.io/feed/) **[New]** includes some of the ideas I find interesting across the web.
