Hello, I'm am currently a student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) pursuing my [MS in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science). I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer and Communication Engineering at [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://manipal.edu/mit.html) in Manipal, Karnataka, India. 
<br>

My research interests are in the field of Computer Vision, Continual Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Semi/Self-supervised Learning and NLP. Solving deep learning problems using a limited (ideally zero) amount of data is what piques my interest. 
<br>

Prior to this I have worked as a research assistant at the Aritificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India in the field of Continual Zero-Shot Learning. I have also worked as a AI Developer at Project MANAS working on their self-driving car and later as a AI Researcher at Research Society Manipal where I primarily worked in developing AI solutions in low resource scenarios. 
<br>

During my free time I try to stream research paper explanations on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/SahilKhose). 
The [Talks section](https://sahilkhose.github.io/talks/) include the explanations presented by me.
The [Feed section](https://sahilkhose.github.io/feed/) **[New]** includes some of the ideas I find interesting across the web. 
<br>

I am always open to research collaborations, so if you want to discuss projects that I have worked on or a potential collaboration, feel free to drop a mail at sahil(dot)khose(at)gatech(dot)edu. Check out my work in my [CV](https://sahilkhose.github.io/files/Sahil_Khose.pdf).
