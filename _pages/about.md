I’m Neeraja Kirtane, my research is focused on building trustworthy and interpretable language models. My work lies at the intersection of AI safety, robustness, and interpretability, with the goal of making large language models (LLMs) more reliable and transparent. 

I’m currently a Research Engineer at **[MathGPT.ai](https://mathgpt.ai)**, where I’m developing education-centric reasoning benchmarks to evaluate reasoning robustness in state-of-the-art models. My [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06430?) explores how simple linguistic or contextual changes can destabilize model reasoning — and how fine-tuning small language models (SLMs) can improve their consistency and usefulness in AI tutoring and educational applications.

Alongside this, I am working under the supervision of **[Prof. Kuan-Hao Huang](https://khhuang.me/)** at Texas A&M University to probe reasoning and multilingual generalization in LLMs. Using interpretability tools such as neuron activation analysis and feature attribution, we are studying how models encode reasoning processes across languages and how these representations transfer between linguistic systems.

Before this, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), where I was advised by [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/) and [Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tür](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/dilek).
At UIUC, I worked on projects aimed at improving trust and accountability in LLMs:

- **[FactCheckmate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02899)** – a framework for preemptively detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs by analyzing their hidden-state dynamics and identifying early indicators of factual inconsistency.

-**[Jailbreaking LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14073)** – a study of scientific-sounding adversarial prompts that can elicit biased or toxic model responses, revealing deeper vulnerabilities in instruction-following and safety alignment.



<!-- I’m **Neeraja Kirtane**, a recent **MSCS graduate** from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I was advised by [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/) and [Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tür](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/dilek).

My research focuses on building **trustworthy and interpretable NLP systems**. At UIUC, I worked on:

- **[FactCheckmate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02899)**: Preemptively detecting and mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their hidden states.
- **[Jailbreaking LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14073)**: Designing scientific-sounding prompts that elicit biased or toxic responses from LLMs, revealing vulnerabilities in instruction following.

Currently, I am:
- Collaborating with **[Prof. Kuan-Hao Huang](https://khhuang.me/)** (Texas A&M University) on probing reasoning in **multilingual LLMs** using interpretability tools.
- Interning at **[MathGPT.ai](https://mathgpt.ai)**, where I’m developing a **benchmark** to evaluate the reasoning robustness of SOTA models and fine-tuning **small language models (SLMs)** for AI tutoring needs and applications.

Previously, I was a **Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow** at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI (RBCDSAI)](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/) at **IIT Madras**, advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/), where I built intelligent tools to generate Wikipedia biographies for women in STEM. -->

I’m currently seeking **PhD opportunities** or **full-time research roles** in _AI safety, robustness, and interpretability_.

<!-- I worked with Prof. Balaraman Ravindran and Dr Rajashree Baskaran on the project [Hidden Voices](https://hidden-voices.github.io/). This is an open-source project with the initial goal of building intelligent tools to aid in adding 10,000 women's biography drafts to Wikipedia. It aims to make a positive impact on gender representation among digital sources and to reduce the gender data gap. Previously in my undergraduate studies, I have worked on finding out occupational stereotypes and mitigating the gender bias in Hindi and Marathi language models. -->

<!-- I am Neeraja Kirtane, a final year undergrad student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. Currently I am interning at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artifical Intelligence(RBCDSAI) at IIT Chennai, where I am working on graph DL. I am very passionate about Technology and Maths and love to learn new things. Previously I have worked on finding and mitigating gender bias from text data. I have specifically worked in Hindi and Marathi languages to address this gender bias issue. I strongly believe that technology should not be just restricted to English speakers and should be available to all. Also, these systems should be free from bias of all forms. My research interests lie in NLP and Graph Deep Learning. I am specifically interested in Fairness in NLP as well working on low resource and gendered languages in NLP. I believe in socially aware and ethically responsible AI systems. \
