Deep Mind's breakthrough paper: 'Contrastive Predictive Coding 2.0' (CPC 2)
CPC 2 not only crushes AlexNet 's scores of 59.3% and 81.8% Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies with just 2% of the ImageNet data (60.4% and 83.9%) but given just 1% of the ImageNet data it achieves 78.3% Top-5 acc outperforming supervised classifier trained on 5x more data! Continuing with training on all the available images (100%) it not just outperforms fully supervised systems by 3.2% (Top-1 acc) but it still manages to outperform these supervised models with just 50% of the ImageNet data!
