* **Neeraja Kirtane** and Tanvi Anand<br><br> Created a dataset of occupations and emotion in Hindi and Marathi. Proposed methods to quantify the bias in the word embeddings. Used existing methods to debias the embeddings.

<!-- Sketches are a medium to convey a visual scene from an individual's creative perspective. The addition of color substantially enhances the overall expressivity of a sketch. This paper proposes two methods to mimic human-drawn colored sketches by utilizing the Contour Drawing Dataset. Our first approach renders colored outline sketches by applying image processing techniques aided by k-means color clustering. The second method uses a generative adversarial network to develop a model that can generate colored sketches from previously unobserved images. We assess the results obtained through quantitative and qualitative evaluations. -->
