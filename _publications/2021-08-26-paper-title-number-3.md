*Harsh Rathod, Manisimha Varma, Parna Chowdhury, Sameer Saxena, V Manushree, Ankita Ghosh*, **Sahil Khose**<br><br>Sketches are a medium to convey a visual scene from an individual's creative perspective. The addition of color substantially enhances the overall expressivity of a sketch. This paper proposes two methods to mimic human-drawn colored sketches by utilizing the Contour Drawing Dataset. Our first approach renders colored outline sketches by applying image processing techniques aided by k-means color clustering. The second method uses a generative adversarial network to develop a model that can generate colored sketches from previously unobserved images. We assess the results obtained through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
