**Neeraja Kirtane**, Anuraag Shankar, Chelsi Jain, Ganesh Katrapati, Senthamizhan V, Raji Baskaran, Balaraman Ravindran<br><br> Wikipedia is the most widely available structured repository of information on the Internet. However, gender disparity has been observed in wiki articles, and it is a major issue. We aim to tackle this problem using Machine Learning methods to generate wiki-like biographies for notable women on Wikipedia. We present Hidden Voices, a project which will assist wiki editors and enthusiasts in writing more biographies about women, thereby increasing their representation on Wikipedia.
